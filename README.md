## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This example serves as an MVP which aims to demonstrates how the Web Monetization API works.

Wrapping your ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù (monetized-only) content in the `IfWebMonetized` component _is not secure_. The content still gets sent, just not rendered; it will be easy for tech-savvy visitors to find it. Don‚Äôt use it for sensitive data, and consider using serverless/cloud functions for better security.

Also, make sure your source code (eg. Github repository) is set to private. üò¨
