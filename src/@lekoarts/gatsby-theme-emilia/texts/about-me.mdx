## About This Site

This is not an actual photography website (you don’t say…). This site demonstrates the integration of [Gatsby Web Monetization Theme](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-theme-web-monetization) in a photographer portfolio site. See [the site code here](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-starter-web-monetization-blog).

Visitors with [Web Monetization](http://webmonetization.org) enabled on their browser will stream _micro payments_ (tiny, periodic batches of payment) to you as they browse the site. In exchange, they can download a hi-res version of your image files. This is done using components provided by the theme, so you can customize the behaviour _any way you want_—for example, have visitors enter their email to get the download link instead of direct download link.

All photos are by me (Eka @ekafyi) and are under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). <small>Why anyone would want to use these, though, is beyond me.</small>
